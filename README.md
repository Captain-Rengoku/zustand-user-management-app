# User Management App

This is a basic user management project built using React and TypeScript. The main goal of this project was to learn and practice state management with Zustand.

Along the way, I also explored React Hook Form for handling form inputs, Zod for form validation, and Bootstrap for styling and layout.

The app displays a list of users, allows adding new ones, and provides a clean and responsive user interface.

It helped me understand how to manage state efficiently, handle form validation in a type-safe way, and structure components neatly in a small project.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- React with TypeScript for building components
- Zustand for global state management
- React Hook Form for form control
- Zod for schema validation
- React Bootstrap for styling
- Lucide React for icons

## What I Learned

While building this project, I learned:

- How to manage global state in React using Zustand
- How to handle forms effectively with React Hook Form
- How to integrate Zod for validation with TypeScript types
- How to use Bootstrap to make a responsive and clean UI
- How to structure a simple React project for better readability and scalability

## Future Improvements

In future iterations, I plan to:

- Add a JSON server to persist user data
- Add modal forms for adding and editing users
- Improve validation and user feedback
- Possibly integrate Zustand middleware for async operations

This project served as a great hands-on exercise for understanding Zustand and improving my overall React and TypeScript skills.
